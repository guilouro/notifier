# Notifier

Realtime Web Application

## Requirements
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Installation
Open your terminal and get Notifier up & running:

1. `$ cd path/to/notifier`
2. `$ vagrant up`
3. `$ vagrant ssh`
4. `$ cd /vagrant/api`
5. `$ python main.py`
6. Go to 192.168.33.10:8080 and *BANG*!

## Beta Project
The project is just a realtime public chat for now.
Once a client consumes a content, that content will be no more available.

## Roadmap
I'm still thinking on improvements...
